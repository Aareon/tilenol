# Shortcuts in this file written in manner, similar to vim mappings. There are
# modifiers:
#
#   * W - Mod4 (usually a Win key)
#   * S - Shift
#   * C - Ctrl
#
# Keys with modifiers are prepended with modifier key and a dash:
#
#   * W-1 -- Mod4 and 1 digit
#   * WS-a -- Mod4 + Shift + letter a
#
# Note: for shift modifier you must not uppercase letter specified
#
# Keys are called with their Xkeysym spelling. The rule of thumb is: letters
# and digits are spelled as is, and other keys you can look at:
#
#   * /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
#   * /usr/include/X11/XF86keysym.h  (for multimedia keys)
#
# Every command in this file is space separated sequence of:
#
#    object command [arg1 [arg2 ...]]
#
# For example ``env`` object is in charge for running a command, so the
# following executes a terminal command:
<W-o>: env exec terminal
# The only way to discover which command supports which object at the moment
# is grep for `cmd_*` methods in the respective classes
